\title{Predict method for Common Components Latent Class Discriminant Analysis (CCLCDA)}
\description{Classifies new observations using parameters determined by
the \code{cclcda}-function.
}
\usage{
\method{predict}{cclcda}(object, newdata, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{object}{Object of class \code{cclcda}.}
  \item{newdata}{Data frame of cases to be classified.}
  \item{\dots}{Further arguments are ignored.}
}
\details{Posterior probabilities for new observations using parameters determined by
the \code{cclcda}-function are computed. The classification of the new data is done by the Bayes decision function.
}
\value{A list with components:
\item{class}{Vector (of class \code{factor}) of classifications.}
\item{posterior}{Posterior probabilities for the classes. 
    For details of computation see \code{\link{cclcda}}.}
